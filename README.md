# C-Project2022 - Created by James O'Brien on 19th august
This project assignment was set my my university (UEA) as part of the programming 2 module in 2nd year. 
In order to refamiliarise myself with the syntax and intricacies of c++ programming, I decided to go back and rebuild this project.

The assignment specifications can be found in the coursework2.pdf file, but it is essentially a fairly simple object oriented application.
